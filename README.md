# CSharpQuestions

1. Q: What is a namespace?
  It is a container of an environment that holds all of the code and work that is done in a software project.
2. Q: What are value types?
  Value types are the types that variables hold.
3. Q: What are reference types?
  A reference type is a reference to a different value type.
4. Q: What is an automatic property and how is it useful?
  Automatic properties are just simplified get/setters they make the code much more streamlined.
5. Q: What is the purpose of using statement?
  Allows the programmer to use outside code by linking it to your document.
6. Q: What are dynamic type variables?
  Variables that can change the value type that they hold.
7. Q: What is the purpose of the is operator?
  It evaluates the type of something.
8. Q: What are generics and how is using them useful?
  A generic is a collection of objects and they are useful because they help you manage less things with less code.
9. Q: What is the scope of a public member of a class?
  Can be used by anything in or outside of a class.
10. Q: Can you create a function that can accept a varying number of arguments?
  Yes of course you can, as many as you want.
11. Q: How do you sort an array?
  There is an Array.Sort method you could use, or you could write your own sorting logic.
12. Q: What is a nullable type and what purpose does it serve?
  A nullable type can be any value type including a null type. It is very versatile in that it can change.
13. Q: What is an enumeration?  
  It essentially is a custom created variable that you can use.
14. Q: What is inheritance?
  When a class inherits properties from another parent class.
15. Q: Is multiple inheritance supported?
  No it is not, unless you are using interfaces.
16. Q: What is the purpose of as operator
  The purpose of as is to perform certain conversions o reference types rather that value types.
17. Q: What is an object?
  An object is a thing that has properties and values that define it within it.
18. Q: What is the difference between a struct and a class?
  A class is code that has properties that define what it is and a struct is a variable that has propeties of its own.
19. Q: What is the difference between continue and break statements?
  The continue statement continues on to the next part of the same code instance, but break breaks out of the segment of code entirely.
20. Q: What is this and how is it used?
  This is used to reference variables and methods that are within the confines of a class.
21. Q: What is try and catch and when are they used?
  Try and catch are error catching blocks that allow you to try to do something and then catch if it goes wrong and spits back an error.   They are used when trying to open a file for instance.
22. Q: How is exception handling done?
  When an exceptional circumstance happens the program will throw back an exception that can be handled by the code.
23. Q: What is finally and what is its purpose?
  Finally is used when you want something to happen after a try catch no matter what happens.
24. Q: List the differences between Array and ArrayList.
  An Array has a predefined type and size while an ArrayList can store any type of element and can grow and shrink dynamically with the   code.
25. Q: What is an object?
  An object is a thing that has properties and values that define it within it.
26. Q: Define constructor.
  A constructor is a method that is always called when a class is instantiated.
27. Q: When can var be used to declare a variable and how is the type for the variable determined?
  var can be used in a class and the type is determined when the variable is initialized.
28. Q: What is an abstract class?
  An abstract class is similar to an interface, but it is different because it is a class and the child of the class has to look up to     the abstract class. It also can define things more specifically. Also a class can inherit many interfaces but only one abstract class.
29. Q: What is an interface?
  An interface is like a set of rules for your code basically making sure that it looks a certain way and has a few certain things.
30. Q: What is a method?
  A method is set of code that can be called and ran many different times to do some logic.
31. Q: What is a property?
  
32. Q: What is an access specifier?
33. Q: What access specifiers are supported and what do they mean?
34. Q: What is a collection?
35. Q: What is a Hash Table?
